# TASK-14-Model-Comparison-Best-Model-Selection
Model comparison project using Breast Cancer dataset. Multiple ML models are trained and evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Best model is selected based on generalization and saved for deployment readiness.

## 📌 Objective
To compare multiple machine learning models on a single dataset and identify the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics and generalization ability.

## 📂 Dataset
Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset (Primary dataset from sklearn)

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Joblib

## ⚙️ Workflow
1. Load and preprocess dataset
2. Train-test split (same split for all models)
3. Train multiple ML models:
   - Logistic Regression
   - Decision Tree
   - Random Forest
   - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
4. Evaluate using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
5. Create model comparison table
6. Plot comparison chart
7. Identify overfitting using train vs test accuracy
8. Select best model and save it

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score

## 🏆 Best Model
Random Forest Classifier (best balance between performance and generalization)

## 📁 Deliverables
- Model comparison table
- Performance comparison plot
- Saved best model

## 🎯 Final Outcome
Hands-on experience in model selection and evaluation, similar to industry ML workflows.
